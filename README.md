# Colchester-City-Guide-App
An android application developed to help people navigate around the city of Colchester. 
This app suggests must see places, take a break and visit well known pubs and restaurant. 
It also contains the history of the town of Colchester. This app also provides information on different types of cab, bus and train services available.
Each of the places have a link attached to the button which sets the map to the location of the place from user's current location. 
I have used View Flipper to automatically change image horizontally along with other basic Image views.
